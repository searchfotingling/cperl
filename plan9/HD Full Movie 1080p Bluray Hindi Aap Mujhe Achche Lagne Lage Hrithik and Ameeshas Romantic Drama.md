The film was Hrithik Roshan and Ameesha Patel's second collaboration after their blockbuster debut Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai (2000). The film was expected to repeat the success of their first film, but it failed to impress the critics and the audience. The film was criticized for its weak script, poor direction, unrealistic action scenes and lack of chemistry between the lead pair. The film was also compared unfavorably with Rakesh Roshan's Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai, which had a similar plot and theme.
 
The film was also involved in a controversy when the producer Rohit Kumar accused Hrithik Roshan of interfering in the creative process and demanding changes in the script and the songs. He also claimed that Hrithik Roshan did not promote the film properly and blamed him for the film's failure. Hrithik Roshan denied these allegations and said that he had no issues with the producer or the director. He also said that he did his best to make the film a success and that he was proud of his work.
 
The film has a cult following among some fans who appreciate the film for its music, dance and action. The film is also considered as one of Hrithik Roshan's underrated performances. The film has some emotional scenes where Hrithik Roshan showcases his acting skills and expresses his love for Ameesha Patel. The film also has some humorous moments where Hrithik Roshan interacts with his friends and tries to impress Sapna's father. The film is a roller coaster ride of emotions and entertainment.
