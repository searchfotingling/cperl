Osho Gita Darshan is a series of 18 volumes that contain Osho's discourses on the 18 chapters of the Bhagavad Gita. Osho delivered these discourses in Hindi between 1970 and 1973, and they were later translated into English by his disciples. Osho Gita Darshan is not a literal interpretation of the Bhagavad Gita, but a creative and original commentary that reveals the hidden meanings and messages of this ancient scripture.
 
Osho Gita Darshan is a treasure for anyone who wants to understand the essence of life, the nature of existence, and the path of liberation. Osho brings a fresh and contemporary perspective to the timeless teachings of Krishna, the enlightened master who spoke the Bhagavad Gita to his disciple Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra. Osho shows how the Bhagavad Gita is not only relevant for ancient times, but also for our modern times, where we face similar challenges and dilemmas.
 
Osho Gita Darshan is not a book to be read, but to be lived. It is a book that invites you to experiment with its insights and apply them to your own life. It is a book that will transform you, if you are open and receptive to its message. It is a book that will awaken you to your true potential, your inner beauty, and your divine nature.

In this article, we will explore some of the main themes and topics that Osho covers in his Gita Darshan. We will also share some of the quotes and anecdotes that Osho uses to illustrate his points and make his discourses more lively and engaging.
 
## The Meaning of Dharma
 
One of the key concepts that Osho explains in his Gita Darshan is the meaning of dharma. Dharma is often translated as duty, religion, or righteousness, but Osho says that these are all superficial and misleading interpretations. Dharma, according to Osho, is the intrinsic nature of each individual, the inner law that guides one's actions and decisions. Dharma is not something imposed by society, tradition, or morality, but something discovered by oneself through meditation and awareness.
 
Osho says that dharma is not a fixed or static thing, but a dynamic and evolving process. Dharma changes according to one's stage of growth, one's level of consciousness, and one's situation in life. Dharma is not a rigid formula or a set of rules, but a creative and spontaneous expression of one's being. Dharma is not a burden or a bondage, but a freedom and a joy.
 
Osho gives the example of Arjuna, the hero of the Bhagavad Gita, who faces a dilemma on the battlefield. Arjuna is torn between his duty as a warrior and his love for his relatives and friends who are on the opposite side. He is confused about what his dharma is in this situation. Osho says that Arjuna's dharma is not to follow his emotions or his intellect, but to listen to his inner voice, his intuition, his heart. Osho says that Arjuna's dharma is to fight, not out of violence or hatred, but out of love and compassion. Arjuna's dharma is to participate in the cosmic play of existence, not out of attachment or ego, but out of detachment and surrender.
 
## The Art of Meditation
 
Another important theme that Osho discusses in his Gita Darshan is the art of meditation. Meditation, according to Osho, is not a technique or a practice, but a state of being. Meditation is not something that one does, but something that one is. Meditation is not a goal or an achievement, but a journey and an adventure.
 
Osho says that meditation is the natural state of every human being, but we have lost it due to our conditioning and our identification with the mind. Meditation is the way to reclaim our original innocence and our true nature. Meditation is the way to go beyond the mind and enter into the realm of no-mind, where there is silence, peace, and bliss.
 
Osho says that meditation is not a serious or solemn affair, but a playful and joyful one. Meditation is not a renunciation or an escape from life, but a celebration and an enhancement of life. Meditation is not a withdrawal or an isolation from others, but a connection and a communion with others.
 
Osho gives many practical tips and suggestions on how to meditate in daily life. He says that meditation can be done anytime and anywhere, with any activity or no activity. He says that meditation can be done with breathing, with walking, with dancing, with singing, with laughing, with loving. He says that meditation can be done with anything that brings you into the present moment, into the here and now.
