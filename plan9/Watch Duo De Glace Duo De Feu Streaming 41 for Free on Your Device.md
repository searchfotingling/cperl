One of the highlights of the album is the song "Streaming 41", which is a tribute to the 41 victims of the fire that broke out in a nightclub in Buenos Aires in 2014. The song is a powerful expression of grief and solidarity, as well as a call for justice and accountability. The song also references the ice sculpture that was installed in front of the nightclub in 2016, as a symbol of memory and hope[^3^]. The song has received positive feedback from fans and critics alike, who praised its emotional depth and musical quality.
 
Duo De Glace Duo De Feu is not only a musical project, but also a social one. The duo aims to raise awareness and funds for causes related to ice and fire, such as climate change, human rights, and disaster relief. They also plan to perform live shows on ice rinks and fire stages, creating a unique and immersive experience for their audience. Duo De Glace Duo De Feu is a project that celebrates the diversity and beauty of life, as well as the strength and resilience of the human spirit.
