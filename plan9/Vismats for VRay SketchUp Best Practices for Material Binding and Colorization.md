# How to Use Vismats for V-Ray SketchUp: A Complete Guide
  
Vismats are materials that can be applied to 3D models using V-Ray, a powerful rendering plugin for SketchUp and Rhino. Vismats can enhance the realism and appearance of your 3D scenes by adding textures, colors, reflections, bumps, displacements and more. In this article, we will show you how to use vismats for V-Ray SketchUp, where to find them, and how to create your own.
  
## What are Vismats?
  
Vismats are files that contain information about the material properties of a surface, such as diffuse color, specular color, reflection, refraction, glossiness, bump map, displacement map and so on. Vismats are usually saved with the extension .vismat or .vrmat, depending on the version of V-Ray you are using. Vismats can be applied to any 3D object in SketchUp or Rhino using the V-Ray Material Editor.
