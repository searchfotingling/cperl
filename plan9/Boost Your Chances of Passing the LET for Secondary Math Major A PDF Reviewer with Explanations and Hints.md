## Why You Need to Review for the LET Exam
  
The LET exam is one of the most challenging and competitive exams in the Philippines. It is administered by the Professional Regulation Commission (PRC) twice a year, usually in March and September. The exam consists of three parts: General Education (Gen Ed), Professional Education (Prof Ed), and Majorship or Area of Specialization.
  
The passing rate for the LET exam varies depending on the number of takers and the difficulty level of the exam. According to the PRC, the average passing rate for the LET exam from 2016 to 2020 was 31.34%. This means that only about three out of ten takers passed the exam.
  
As a secondary math major, you need to pass both the Prof Ed and Math tests of the LET exam. The Prof Ed test has 150 questions that cover topics such as teaching principles and methods, curriculum development, assessment and evaluation, learning theories, educational laws and policies, and code of ethics. The Math test has 100 questions that cover topics such as algebra, geometry, trigonometry, calculus, statistics, probability, logic, and problem-solving.
  
Both tests have a time limit of two hours and 30 minutes each. You need to score at least 75% on each test to pass. This means that you need to answer at least 113 questions correctly on the Prof Ed test and at least 75 questions correctly on the Math test.
  
Given the scope and difficulty of the LET exam, you cannot rely on your college education alone to pass it. You need to review extensively and systematically to refresh your knowledge and skills in mathematics and professional education. You also need to familiarize yourself with the format and types of questions on the LET exam. You need to practice answering questions under time pressure and learn how to manage your time wisely.
  
That's why you need a reviewer that will help you prepare for the LET exam in an effective and efficient way. A reviewer that will not only give you information but also skills and strategies that will make you a better test-taker.
