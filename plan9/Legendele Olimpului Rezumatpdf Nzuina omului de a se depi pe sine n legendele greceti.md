Legendele Olimpului Rezumat.pdf is a document that contains a summary of the book "Legendele Olimpului" (The Legends of Olympus) by Alexandru Mitru, a Romanian writer who published it in 1960. The book is divided into two parts: "Zeii" (The Gods) and "Eroii" (The Heroes), and narrates the legendary deeds of some mythological characters from ancient Greece. In 1972, the book received the Ion CreangÄ award from the Romanian Academy.
 
The first part of the book, "Zeii", tells the story of the origin and evolution of the gods, from the primordial chaos to the reign of Zeus. It describes how Gheea, the goddess of the earth, and Uranus, the god of the sky, gave birth to the titans, the cyclops, and other monstrous beings. Uranus feared that one of his children would overthrow him, so he imprisoned them in Tartarus, a dark abyss. Gheea helped her son Cronos to escape and wound Uranus with a diamond sickle. Cronos became the ruler of the earth and the sky, but he also faced a prophecy that he would be dethroned by one of his sons. He decided to swallow his children as soon as they were born: Hestia, Demeter, Hera, Hades, and Poseidon. His wife Reea managed to save their sixth child, Zeus, by hiding him in a cave on Crete and giving Cronos a stone wrapped in swaddling clothes. Zeus grew up strong and powerful and eventually challenged Cronos and his allies, the titans. He freed his siblings from Cronos' stomach and led them to a war that lasted ten years. With the help of some titans who switched sides, such as Oceanus and Prometheus, and some other creatures that emerged from chaos, such as Nix (the night), Eris (the discord), Nemesis (the revenge), Apate (the deception), Ker (the destruction), and Thanatos (the death), Zeus defeated Cronos and banished him and his followers to Tartarus. Zeus became the supreme god of Olympus and divided the world with his brothers: Hades got the underworld, Poseidon got the sea, and Zeus got the sky. The rest of the part narrates the adventures and affairs of Zeus and his fellow gods and goddesses, such as Hera, Athena, Apollo, Artemis, Hermes, Aphrodite, Ares, Hephaestus, Dionysus, Persephone, and others.
