## What is included in the pack and how to access it
 
Cory Friesenhan Vocal Sessions MULTiFORMAT is a 1 GB pack that contains over 540 WAV files of vocal samples. All vocal samples are royalty free so you can use them in your own commercial productions. The pack is divided into these sections:

1. **Songs** â 12 masterly crafted songs ranging from soft and melodic to hard and driving utilizing Coryâs wide range of vocal styles. The variety included in this pack makes it an excellent tool for producers of all genres. Many of the songs contain multiple parts, alternate takes, double trackings, harmonies and extras so you can really find your own sound within the pack. All songs are labelled with the original key they were recorded to and will stretch to a wide range and tempos while still sounding musical.
2. **Loops** â Gated loops and mutated vocal textures great for filling in beat loops and adding interesting rhythmic vocal bits into your songs.
3. **Swells** â Epic choir like swells containing minor, major, fifth, and single note crescendos. Great for building intensity and helping transitions.
4. **Tones** â Over 230 vowel recordings spanning 2.5 octaves including both straight tone and falsetto on the higher pitches. Tones were recorded at vowels Ooh, Ohh, Ahh, Ehh, Eee, and humming Mmm. Choir like presets for Directwave and Kontakt have been added as a bonus. These tones are great for sound design and for creating interesting vocal soundscapes. All of the vocal swell samples have been created using these tones.
5. **Vocal FX** â Reverse tones and vocal breaths great for transitioning. Throw some rhythmic gates or sidechain on top these for some great results.
6. **Xtras** â Over 100MB worth of extra runs & vocal licks all labelled with the key they were recorded too. These are great tools to fill in breaks and perfect for sections of songs where an extra vocal element is desired. These are also excellent for stretching, gating, and chopping up.

To access the pack, you will need to download it from the Black Octopus Sound website using the link below[^1^]. You will receive a zip file that contains all the WAV files organized in folders according to their sections. You can unzip the file using any software that can handle zip files such as WinZip or 7-Zip. Once you have unzipped the file, you can import the WAV files into your DAW or sampler of choice.
 
## How to use the songs, loops, swells, tones, vocal FX and xtras sections
 
The songs section is probably the most versatile and useful part of the pack. You can use them as they are or chop them up into smaller parts to fit your arrangement. You can also layer different parts from different songs to create new combinations
