This cheat is based on the one posted by user **zJanny** on the website **unknowncheats.me** [^1^]. We will also explain how to use the cheat safely and avoid getting banned by the game's anti-cheat system.
 
## How to Download and Install the Cheat
 
The first step is to download the cheat file from the link provided by zJanny on unknowncheats.me [^1^]. The file is a zip archive that contains two files: **Descenders.dll** and **Injector.exe**. You will need to extract these files to a folder on your computer.
 
The next step is to launch the game and wait until you are in the main menu. Then, you will need to run the Injector.exe file as administrator. This will inject the Descenders.dll file into the game's process and activate the cheat. You should see a message saying "Injection successful" in the console window.
 
Now, you can press **F1** to open the cheat menu and customize the settings according to your preferences. You can also use the arrow keys and **Enter** to navigate the menu and toggle the features on or off.
 
## How to Use the Cheat Features
 
The cheat has many features that can enhance your gameplay experience and give you an edge over other players. Here are some of the most useful ones:
 
- **Fly Hack:** This feature allows you to fly around the map and explore different areas. You can use **WASD** to move and **Space** to ascend or descend. You can also adjust the camera sensitivity and move speed in the cheat menu.
- **ESP:** This feature enables you to see other players' names, health, distance, and team color through walls and objects. You can also see their bikes and trails. This can help you locate your friends or enemies and plan your moves accordingly.
- **Unlock All:** This feature unlocks all items, maps, achievements, and team divisions in the game. You can access them from your inventory or career mode. You can also add all modifiers or custom score to your runs for more challenge or fun.
- **Unlimited Bails:** This feature prevents you from losing health or reputation when you bail or crash. You can keep riding without worrying about consequences or penalties.
- **Jump to Finish Line:** This feature teleports you to the end of the current map instantly. You can use this to skip difficult or boring sections or to complete missions faster.
- **Reset Player:** This feature resets your position and orientation to where you started the map. You can use this to retry a section or avoid falling off cliffs or obstacles.

## How to Use the Cheat Safely
 
The cheat is undetected by the game's anti-cheat system at the time of writing this article. However, this does not mean that you are completely safe from getting banned. The game developers or moderators might still notice your suspicious behavior or reports from other players and take action against you.
 
To avoid getting banned, we recommend that you use the cheat with caution and moderation. Do not abuse the features or ruin other players' enjoyment of the game.
