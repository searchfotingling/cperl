Meri Jung Ka Elaan is a film that can be enjoyed by fans of Dharmendra and B-grade cinema. It is a film that does not shy away from showing the harsh realities of rape and revenge, but also offers some entertainment and humor along the way. It is a film that celebrates the spirit of courage and justice in the face of adversity.
  
One of the highlights of Meri Jung Ka Elaan is the performance of Dharmendra, who plays the role of Ajit Singh with conviction and charisma. He brings out the emotions of a man who has lost his family and his honor, and who wants to help Durga in her quest for revenge. He also displays his action skills and comic timing in various scenes. Dharmendra is well supported by Sapna Sappu, who plays the role of Durga with courage and determination. She portrays the trauma and the transformation of her character with sincerity and grace.
 
Another aspect of Meri Jung Ka Elaan that deserves mention is the cinematography by S. Pappu. He captures the rustic and rugged locations of Rajasthan and Gujarat, where the film is set, with vivid colors and angles. He also creates a contrast between the bright and cheerful scenes of Durga's childhood and the dark and gloomy scenes of her rape and revenge. The cinematography adds to the visual appeal and the mood of the film.
 
However, Meri Jung Ka Elaan also has its share of flaws and drawbacks. The film suffers from a weak script by Bashir Babar, who fails to create a coherent and engaging story. The film has many loopholes and inconsistencies in its plot and characters. The film also has poor editing by Kanti Shah, who makes the film unnecessarily long and repetitive. The film could have been trimmed by at least 20 minutes to make it more crisp and tight.
