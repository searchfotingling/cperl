## Tips and Tricks for Using Capella Wave Kit 2.0
 
Here are some tips and tricks that can help you get the most out of Capella Wave Kit 2.0:

- Before you start the tone recognition process, make sure that your audio file is of good quality and has a clear melody. You can use an audio editor to trim, normalize, or filter your file if needed.
- If the tone recognition results are not satisfactory, you can try adjusting the sensitivity and accuracy sliders. A higher sensitivity will detect more tones, but may also include noise or false positives. A higher accuracy will refine the tone detection, but may also miss some tones or split them into multiple parts.
- You can use the keyboard shortcuts to speed up your editing process. For example, you can press the spacebar to play or pause the waveform, use the arrow keys to move the cursor or select tones, and press the delete key to delete a tone.
- You can use the "Undo" and "Redo" buttons to revert or repeat your actions. You can also use the "History" panel to view and jump to any previous state of your file.
- You can use the "Options" menu to customize various settings of the software, such as the language, the interface theme, the playback device, and the export options.
