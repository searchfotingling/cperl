One of the main themes of the book is the concept of "api sejarah", which means "the fire of history". The author argues that history is not a static and objective record of the past, but a dynamic and subjective process of interpretation and representation. History is also a source of inspiration and guidance for the present and the future. The author invites the readers to ignite the fire of history in their hearts and minds, and to use it as a tool for enlightenment and empowerment.
 
Another theme of the book is the relationship between Indonesia and Islam. The author shows that Islam is not a foreign or alien religion to Indonesia, but a natural and integral part of its culture and civilization. Islam has been present in Indonesia since the seventh century, and has influenced its political, social, economic, and artistic development. Islam has also been a force of resistance and liberation against colonialism and oppression. The author asserts that Islam is the identity and destiny of Indonesia, and that Indonesia has a unique role and responsibility in the Muslim world.

The book also challenges some of the common myths and misconceptions about Indonesia and Islam. For example, the book debunks the idea that Indonesia was a Hindu-Buddhist kingdom before Islam, and that Islam was spread by violence and coercion. The book also refutes the notion that Indonesia is a secular state that separates religion and politics, and that Islam is incompatible with democracy and human rights. The book provides evidence and arguments to support its claims and to counter the opposing views.
