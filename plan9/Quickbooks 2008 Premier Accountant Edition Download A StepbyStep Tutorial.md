However, if you have purchased this product online or on CD, you might be wondering how to download and install it on your computer. In this article, we will show you the steps to download QuickBooks 2008 Premier Accountant Edition from the official Intuit website.
 
## Step 1: Find your license and product numbers
 
Before you can download QuickBooks 2008 Premier Accountant Edition, you will need to have your license and product numbers ready.

- If you bought QuickBooks online, check your email for the purchase confirmation from Intuit. It should contain your license and product numbers.
- If you bought QuickBooks on CD, look for the scratch-off label in the original packaging (next to the UPC code). It should reveal your license and product numbers.
- If you are a ProAdvisor or an accountant, log into your QuickBooks ProAdvisor Center or CAMPS account to view your software information.

If you have lost or misplaced your license and product numbers, you can contact Intuit customer support for assistance.
 
## Step 2: Go to the Downloads & Updates page
 
Once you have your license and product numbers, you can go to the Downloads & Updates page on the Intuit website. This is where you can find the download link for your version of QuickBooks. To access this page, follow these steps:
