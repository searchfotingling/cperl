1. Check the system requirements. You need a Mac that can run OS X Snow Leopard 10.6.8, Lion 10.7, or Mountain Lion 10.8 already installed, 2 GB of memory, 8 GB of available space, and an Apple ID[^2^]. Some of the compatible Mac models are: iMac (Mid 2007-2020), MacBook (Late 2008 Aluminum, or Early 2009 or newer), MacBook Pro (Mid/Late 2007 or newer), MacBook Air (Late 2008 or newer), Mac mini (Early 2009 or newer), Mac Pro (Early 2008 or newer), Xserve (Early 2009)[^2^].
2. Download the OS X Mountain Lion Installer App from the Mac App Store. You can either purchase it for $19.99 or re-download it if you have already bought it before[^1^]. To re-download it, launch the Mac App Store and hold down the âOptionâ while clicking on the âPurchasesâ tab. Locate âOS X Mountain Lionâ in the list, and click on the âInstallâ button to redownload[^1^]. You will find the âInstall OS X Mountain Lionâ app in your /Applications/ folder when finished downloading[^1^].
3. Create a bootable USB or ISO of OS X Mountain Lion. This is optional but recommended if you want to have a backup of the installer or install it on multiple Macs. To do this, you need a USB drive with at least 8 GB of space or a blank DVD. You also need to find the InstallESD.dmg disk image inside the Install OS X Mountain Lion app under Contents/SharedSupport/[^3^]. You can use Disk Utility or Terminal to create a bootable USB or ISO from the InstallESD.dmg file[^3^]. You can find detailed instructions on how to do this online[^3^].
4. Install OS X Mountain Lion on your Mac. You can either run the Install OS X Mountain Lion app from your /Applications/ folder or boot from the USB or ISO you created in step 3. Follow the onscreen instructions to install OS X Mountain Lion on your Mac. You may need to change the date setting to October 1st, 2012 in Terminal or System Preferences if you get an error message such as Apple can't verify your computer[^3^]. It should take about 30 minutes to complete the installation.

Congratulations! You have successfully installed OS X Mountain Lion on your Mac. Enjoy its features and performance.
  
## What's New in OS X Mountain Lion?
 
OS X Mountain Lion brings many features from iOS to the Mac, making it easier to stay connected, organized, and entertained. Here are some of the highlights of what's new in OS X Mountain Lion:

- Notifications: You can get alerts for new emails, messages, calendar events, reminders, software updates, and more from a convenient panel on the right side of your screen. You can also customize which apps can send you notifications and how they appear. You can swipe with two fingers to show or hide the Notification Center, or click on the icon in the menu bar.
- AirPlay Mirroring: You can wirelessly stream your Mac's screen to an HDTV using an Apple TV. This is great for watching movies, playing games, giving presentations, or showing off your photos. You can also use your HDTV as a second display for your Mac. AirPlay Mirroring supports 720p resolution and works with iMac (Mid 2011 or newer), Mac mini (Mid 2011 or newer), MacBook Air (Mid 2011 or newer), and MacBook Pro (Early 2011 or newer)[^2^].
- Gatekeeper: You can protect your Mac from malicious software by choosing which sources of apps you trust. You can allow apps downloaded from anywhere, from the Mac App Store and identified developers, or from the Mac App Store only. Gatekeeper also checks for known malware when you install an app and blocks it if it's unsafe.
- Game Center: You can play games with your friends across your Mac, iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch. You can also discover new games, track your achievements, compare scores, and challenge other players. Game Center requires an Apple ID and an Internet connection.
- Notes and Messages: You can create notes with rich text formatting, images, links, and attachments using the Notes app. You can also sync your notes across your devices using iCloud. The Messages app replaces iChat and lets you send unlimited messages to anyone with an iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, or another Mac. You can also send photos, videos, documents, contacts, and group messages. You can start a conversation on one device and continue it on another using iCloud.
